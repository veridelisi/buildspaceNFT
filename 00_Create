//You also deployed a smart contract to a local blockchain.
    //Hardhat compiles your smart contract from solidity to bytecode.
    //Hardhat will spin up a "local blockchain" on your computer. It's like a mini, test version of Ethereum running on your computer to help you quickly test stuff!
    //Hardhat will then "deploy" your compiled contract to your local blockchain. That's that address you see at the end there. It's our deployed contract, on our mini version of Ethereum.
    //Greeter.sol which is the smart contract and sample-script.js which actually runs the contract.
