What are SVGs

<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin meet" viewBox="0 0 350 350">
    <style>.base { fill: white; font-family: serif; font-size: 14px; }</style>
    <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="black" />
    <text x="50%" y="50%" class="base" dominant-baseline="middle" text-anchor="middle">EpicLordHamburger</text>
</svg>


Head to this website (https://www.svgviewer.dev/) and paste in the code above to see it. 



Next, we want a way to somehow get this data in our NFT without hosting it somewhere like imgur (which can go down or die at any moment!). Head to this website.
https://www.utilities-online.info/base64
Paste in your full SVG code above and then click "encode" to get your base64 encoded SVG. Now, ready for some magic? Open a new tab. And in the URL bar paste this:



data:image/svg+xml;base64,INSERT_YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_SVG_HERE


We turned our SVG code into a nice string :). base64 is basically an accepted standard for encoding data into a string. So when we say data:image/svg+xml;base64 
it's basically saying, "Hey, I'm about to give you base64 encoded data please process it as a SVG, thank you!".
Take that whole string data:image/svg+xml;base64,INSERT_YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_SVG_HERE and paste it in your browser's address bar and boom you'll see the SVG! 


Remember
https://jsonkeeper.com/b/RUUS

we  keep

{
    "name": "EpicLordHamburger",
    "description": "An NFT from the highly acclaimed square collection",
    "image": "https://i.imgur.com/v7U019j.png"
}

NOW WE CHANGE THIS

{
    "name": "EpicLordHamburger",
    "description": "An NFT from the highly acclaimed square collection",
    "image": "data:image/svg+xml;base64,INSERT_YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_SVG_HERE"
}



But wait â€” where will our fancy new JSON file go? Right now, we host it on this random website. 
If that website goes down, our beautiful NFT is gone forever! 
Here's what we're going to do. We're going to base64 encode our entire JSON file. Just like we encoded our SVG.
https://www.utilities-online.info/base64
Paste in your full JSON metadata with the base64 encoded SVG (should look sorta like what I have above) and then click "encode" to get you encoded JSON.

Open a new tab. And in the URL bar paste this:

data:application/json;base64,INSERT_YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_JSON_HERE


MyEpicNFT.sol

We just need to change one line.Before we used jsonkeeper, now we use base 64
_setTokenURI(newItemId, "data:application/json;base64,INSERT_BASE_64_ENCODED_JSON_HERE")
