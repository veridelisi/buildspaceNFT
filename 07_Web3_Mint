 Mint NFT through our website.
 We've deployed our website. We've deployed our contract. We've connected our wallet. 
 Now we need to actually call our contract from our web app using the credentials we have access to now from Metamask!
 
 Be sure to import it at the top using 
 import { ethers } from "ethers";
 import MyEpicNFT from './utils/MyEpicNFT.json';
 in App.js
 
 
 So, remember, our contract has the function makeAnEpicNFT which will actually mint the NFT. We'll need to now call this function from our web app. 
 Go ahead and add the following function under the connectWallet function.
 
 
 Go ahead and add the following function under the "connectWallet" function.(App.js)
 
 You need the last deployed address for INSERT_YOUR_DEPLOYED_RINKEBY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
 
 
 const askContractToMintNft = async () => {
 const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "INSERT_YOUR_DEPLOYED_RINKEBY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";

  try {
    const { ethereum } = window;

    if (ethereum) {
      const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(ethereum);
      const signer = provider.getSigner();
      const connectedContract = new ethers.Contract(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, MyEpicNFT.abi, signer);

      console.log("Going to pop wallet now to pay gas...")
      let nftTxn = await connectedContract.makeAnEpicNFT();

      console.log("Mining...please wait.")
      await nftTxn.wait();
      
      console.log(`Mined, see transaction: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/${nftTxn.hash}`);

    } else {
      console.log("Ethereum object doesn't exist!");
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error)
  }
}



Finally, we'll want to call this function when someone clicks the "Mint NFT" button.
onClick={askContractToMintNft}

return (
  {currentAccount === "" 
    ? renderNotConnectedContainer()
    : (
      /** Add askContractToMintNft Action for the onClick event **/
      <button onClick={askContractToMintNft} className="cta-button connect-wallet-button">
        Mint NFT
      </button>
    )
  }
);



The contents of the ABI file can be found in a fancy JSON file in your hardhat project:
artifacts/contracts/MyEpicNFT.sol/MyEpicNFT.json


Copy the contents from your MyEpicNFT.json and then head to your web app. 
You are going to make a new folder called utils under src. Under utils create a file named MyEpicNFT.json
